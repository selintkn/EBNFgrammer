# EBNFgrammer
This project implements a recursive-descent parser in Java to validate arithmetic expressions containing integers, operators (+, −, *, /), and parentheses.
The parser follows an EBNF grammar and correctly enforces operator precedence and nested expressions.
It checks syntax validity without evaluating the expression.
